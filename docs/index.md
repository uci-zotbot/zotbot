### The Alexa Prize Competition

"The Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge is a competition sponsored by Amazon to advance the field of conversation artificial intelligence. Each univesity team is tasked with developing a social-bot that can hold a coherent and engaging conversation on a range of topics with real people. 
Each team has received $250,000 in research funding to provide students with the valuable opportunity to work on an engineering project that's directly accessible by hundreds of thousands of public users. Teams also have access to the Alexa customer reviews to help them make decisions about the complex software engineering pipelines.
