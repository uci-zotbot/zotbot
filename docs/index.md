## About ZotBot

ZotBot is the University of California Irvine’s Amazon Alexa Prize 2019 - 2020 competition team. ZotBot is using artificial intelligence to create a social bot that can communicate with people on current events and popular topics.

### The Alexa Prize Competition

The Amazon Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge is an engineering competition where 10 university teams were selected and tasked with using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a social-bot. Teams will utilize software engineering pipelines to enable the bot to hold a coherent and engaging conversation on a range of topics with people.

Bots will be accessible to Alexa’s current public users to test and provide teams with feedback. Amazon Alexa has provided $250,000 in research funding, access to Alexa customer reviews, Alexa-enabled devices and free Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alexa team support. The winning team will receive $500,000 and depending on their score, a $1 million research grant.
